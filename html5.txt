HTML5 is an update to the HTML specification (5th revision), published by W3C.

Semantic Elements: HTML elements that have plain-english meanings, in addition to what they mean to the browser. For example, a <div> doesn't really mean anything to a lay-person, but <article> certainly does.
- <section>, <article>
- <header>, <footer>
- <nav>
- <figure>, <time>, <details>, <main>

- <section> is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading
- <article> is independent, self-contained content 
*** No reason you couldn't have <articles> in a <section> or <sections> in an article, or <sections> within <sections>, etc etc.

- <header> specifies a header for a document or section; should be used as a container for introductory content.
- <footer> specifies a footer, should have information about its containing element... authorship, copyright, contact, etc etc

- <nav> defines a set of navigation links

ALL THIS SHIT IS JUST <DIV>S BY ANOTHER NAME. Apparently the point is to make it easier for search engines to properly categorize web content. Now, instead of having to parse IDs or classes, there is a standardized set of semantic elements.
